# Prerequisites
1. If you would like to create a new project then you will need to clone this branch and go through Deren's setup process again, otherwise you can just update the local files of the demo.
	> **Files Updated:**
 
	> server.py
 
	> UserTable.js
 
	> view1.jsx
3. Install pymongo and certifi modules within your virtual environment
	> pip install pymongo  
	
	> pip install certifi

**Note:**  If you want to use your own database you will have to update the connection string on line 11 of server.py, otherwise you can use my database.
